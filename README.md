1. Make an android app capable of predicting oncoming of disaster. 
1. This app should be made available to all people of disaster prone areas.
2. The app will show the probable percentage of disaster to happen.
3. This way if percentage rises above alarming threshold it will beep.
4. The app will also provide people information about closest shelter so that they can go there.
5. So it will be useful for newer people residing in those areas.
